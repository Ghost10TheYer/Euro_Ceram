>INCLUDING THE PROJECT
  - First you need to change all your files extension to PHP, otherwise it won't work.
  - include the project by pasting this following php instruction into the body tag of your file
    • <?php
    include_once('products.php');
    ?>

    NOTE: you can paste it wherever you want in the body, for example if want it to be after all the work that you've already done just watch the below example:
      
      <body>
       //your work
       //PASTE IT HERE
      </body>
      
    Or if you want it before:
      
      <body>
       //PASTE IT HERE
       //your work
      </body>

============================================

>STYLING
  -To apply the style (css files) for the project just paste those following link tags into the head tag of your index.php file, or in the head tag of the page of your choice.
  
   • <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" media="all" />
   • <link rel="stylesheet" href="fonts.css" type="text/css" media="all" />
   
   
>DYNAMISM
  -To include the JS files into your project just copy and paste this following script tag into your project (or into the page of your choice).
    • <script src="app.js" type="module" charset="utf-8" async="true"></script>
    
    NOTE: make sure you specify the type attribute to "module" if you decide to write it yourself instead of just copy and paste it.
  
>RESPONSIVENESS
  -Finally to ensure the responsiveness of the page on desktop as well as mobile devices make sure you include that following meta tag as well.
    • <meta name="viewport" content="width:device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    
    
And that wraps it up. That's all you need to enjoy my work, have fun using it and modifying it at your will broh ;).
